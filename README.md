# Bank Management System

## Project Overview
The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based project that simplifies and automates banking operations such as managing accounts, handling transactions, balance inquiries, and more. It provides a user-friendly interface for both customers and administrators to perform various banking functions securely and efficiently.

## Features
- **Account Management**: Create, modify, and delete bank accounts.
- **Deposit & Withdrawal**: Secure transactions, including deposits and withdrawals.
- **Balance Inquiry**: View and manage account balances.
- **Transaction History**: Access a detailed log of all account transactions.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive input validation and error checking.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage customer data and transactions with ease.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse IDE
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing user and transaction data)
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing and AWT (for creating the user interface)

## Installation Guide
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BankManagementSystem.git
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred Java IDE** (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. **Set up the MySQL database**:
   - Create a new database in MySQL named `bank_management_system`.
   - Import the provided SQL file (`bank_management_system.sql`) into your database.

4. **Update the database configuration**:
   - Modify the database connection details in the Java code to match your local MySQL settings (e.g., username, password).

5. **Run the application**:
   - Execute the `Main.java` file to launch the system.

## How It Works
1. **User Registration/Login**: Users can create new accounts or log into existing ones.
2. **Account Operations**: Once logged in, users can perform operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance checks, and transaction history reviews.
3. **Admin Panel**: Admins can manage user accounts and monitor transactions via the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more security layers, such as encryption for sensitive data.
- Implement a notification system for transactions.
- Extend to web-based or mobile banking applications.
